    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (CVE-2023-49092) is a timing side-channel attack (Marvin Attack)
    # that affects PKCS#1 v1.5 DECRYPTION. This codebase only uses ENCRYPTION
    # (encrypting passwords with the server's public key), so the vulnerability
    # does not apply. The server performs decryption, not this client.
    { id = "RUSTSEC-2023-0071", reason = "Only encryption is used, not decryption - Marvin Attack does not apply" },
    # paste is unmaintained but not vulnerable. It's a transitive dependency from
    # parquet (Apache Arrow) - we can't control it. Track: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues
