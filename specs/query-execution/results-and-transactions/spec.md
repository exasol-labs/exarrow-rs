# Feature: Results and Transactions

Specifies result set retrieval, transaction management, and query metadata for SQL query execution.

## Background

Query results are retrieved efficiently with support for both small single-fetch result sets and large paginated result sets. All result data is converted to Arrow RecordBatch format with full schema metadata. Transaction management supports explicit begin/commit/rollback operations as well as auto-commit mode (enabled by default). Query execution metadata including timing, row counts, and warnings is available after each query completes.

## Scenarios

### Scenario: Small result set retrieval

* *GIVEN* a query has been executed
* *WHEN* a query returns a small result set (< 1000 rows)
* *THEN* it SHALL fetch all rows in a single request
* *AND* it SHALL convert data to Arrow RecordBatch

### Scenario: Large result set pagination

* *GIVEN* a query has been executed
* *WHEN* a query returns a large result set
* *THEN* it SHALL support fetching results in batches
* *AND* it SHALL provide mechanisms to retrieve subsequent batches
* *AND* it SHALL maintain result set handle for pagination

### Scenario: Result set metadata

* *GIVEN* a query has been executed
* *WHEN* retrieving result metadata
* *THEN* it SHALL provide column names and types
* *AND* it SHALL provide row count (if available)
* *AND* it SHALL provide Arrow schema

### Scenario: Explicit transaction begin

* *GIVEN* an authenticated connection exists to Exasol
* *WHEN* beginning a transaction explicitly
* *THEN* it SHALL execute BEGIN or START TRANSACTION
* *AND* it SHALL track transaction state

### Scenario: Transaction commit

* *GIVEN* a transaction is in progress
* *WHEN* committing a transaction
* *THEN* it SHALL execute COMMIT
* *AND* it SHALL update transaction state to committed

### Scenario: Transaction rollback

* *GIVEN* a transaction is in progress
* *WHEN* rolling back a transaction
* *THEN* it SHALL execute ROLLBACK
* *AND* it SHALL update transaction state to rolled back

### Scenario: Auto-commit mode

* *GIVEN* an authenticated connection exists to Exasol
* *WHEN* auto-commit is enabled (default)
* *THEN* each statement SHALL be automatically committed
* *AND* explicit transaction commands SHALL override auto-commit temporarily

### Scenario: Execution statistics

* *GIVEN* a query has been executed
* *WHEN* a query completes
* *THEN* it SHALL provide execution time
* *AND* it SHALL provide rows affected/returned
* *AND* it SHALL provide any warnings from the database

### Scenario: Query plan information

* *GIVEN* a query has been executed
* *WHEN* EXPLAIN is used
* *THEN* it SHALL return query execution plan information
* *AND* it SHALL format plan data appropriately for display
